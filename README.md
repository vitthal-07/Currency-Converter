The Currency Converter project offers a user-friendly web interface for effortless currency conversion. Users can input the desired amount and choose source and target currencies from dropdown menus, visually represented with corresponding flags. Utilizing JavaScript, the application dynamically fetches real-time exchange rates from an external API. The selected currencies and input amount drive the calculation of the converted value, promptly displayed to the user. The design is intuitive, allowing for straightforward currency exchange, complemented by a dedicated exchange button to effortlessly swap source and target currencies. This project provides a responsive and visually appealing platform for users to conveniently perform currency conversions.
